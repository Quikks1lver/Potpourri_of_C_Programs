# Potpourri_of_C_Programs
A hodge podge of C programs I wrote for fun during my time at UCF.

If you want to run these programs, ensure you have gcc installed. Then, download the repo, then ```gcc [filename.c]``` for the ```filename.c``` you want to compile. Then run ```./a.out```. Some of the programs will accept arguments right from the command line, so just follow the directions for each program.
