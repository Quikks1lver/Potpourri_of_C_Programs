# Potpourri_of_C_Programs
A hodge podge of C programs I wrote for fun during my time at UCF.

To run the programs:
- Ensure you have the [```gcc``` compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/) installed.
- Download the repo, then ```gcc [filename.c]``` for the ```filename.c``` you want to compile.
- Run ```./a.out```. *Note*: some of the programs will accept arguments right from the command line, so just follow the directions for each program.
- Enjoy!
